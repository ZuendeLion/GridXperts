== HTML Tables
HTML tables allow you to display data in a structured, tabular format on a web page. Tables consist of rows and columns, and you can use various HTML elements to create and style them.

=== <table>
 This is the main element that defines a table on a web page. It is used as a container for all other table-related elements.

=== <tr>
The table row element represents a single row in the table. It is a child element of the <table> and contains one or more table cells, either <td> or <th> elements.

=== <td>
The table data element represents a single cell in the table. It is a child element of the <tr> element and contains the actual data you want to display in the table.

=== <th>
The table header element is similar to the <td> element but is used to represent header cells, which are typically used in the first row of the table to label the columns. <th> elements are also children of the <tr> element.

=== <thead>
The table head element is an optional container for one or more <tr> elements that represent the header row(s) of the table. It helps to separate the header from the table body for styling and accessibility purposes.

=== <tbody>
The table body element is another optional container for one or more <tr> elements that represent the main content of the table. Using <tbody> allows you to apply specific styles to the table body without affecting the header.

=== <tfoot>
The table footer element is an optional container for one or more <tr> elements that represent the footer row(s) of the table. It is used to summarize the table data or provide additional information.

Here's an example of a basic HTML table:

[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>HTML Table Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <table border="1">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Header 1</th>
          <th>Header 2</th>
          <th>Header 3</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Row 1, Cell 1</td>
          <td>Row 1, Cell 2</td>
          <td>Row 1, Cell 3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Row 2, Cell 1</td>
          <td>Row 2, Cell 2</td>
          <td>Row 2, Cell 3</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
      <tfoot>
        <tr>
          <td>Footer 1</td>
          <td>Footer 2</td>
          <td>Footer 3</td>
        </tr>
      </tfoot>
    </table>
  </body>
</html>
----

This example creates a simple table with a header row, two data rows, and a footer row. The border="1" attribute is added to the <table> element to display borders around the cells for better visibility.
